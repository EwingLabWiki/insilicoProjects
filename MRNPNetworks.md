        -   genes with *LEF1* promoter elements, which showed increased
            HuR association from 4 to 12 h. Interestingly, HuR LOD
            scores for *LEF1* went from -0.29 at 0 h, to 1.37 at 4 h, to
            1.13 at 12 h and the HuR promoter contains a predicted
            *LEF1-*binding site. The latter result raised the
            fascinating possibility of a translationally and
            transcriptionally coupled regulatory loop between HuR and
            *LEF1*
